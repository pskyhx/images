# images

useful public domain images

mostly leaves

to run the script that makes the gallery, [`lazygal`](https://github.com/niol/lazygal) ([man page](https://www.mankier.com/1/lazygal)) is required. 

I'm not putting much work into this right now, feel free to download the repositoty by using the menu in the top right corner if you would like to grab all the images. 

There's also a [directory of emojis](https://github.com/pskyhx/kratom-gallery/tree/main/emojis) that `lazygal` was unable to cope with, and are therefor not included in the gallery.
